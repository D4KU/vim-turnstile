*turnstile.txt* Swap the left with the right neighbor of a word

DESCRIPTION                                                         *turnstile*

  This |plugin| provides a |function| to swap the left neighbor of a given
  |word| in the current line with its right neighbor. This is useful when you
  want to swap operands of an arithmetic or |boolean| expression, such as
  `'a'` and `'b'` in `'a - b'` . The plugin is build with the syntax of C-like
  programming languages in mind.


MAPPING                                                     *turnstile-mapping*

  Simply paste the following |mapping| into your |vimrc| and customize it to your
  wishes:
>
    nnoremap <Leader>s :<C-U>call turnstile#turn('')<Left><Left>
<
  Later when you use the mapping your cursor is put in the command line
  between the quotes, ready to insert the word of which its neighbors to swap.
  So if you want to swap `'a'` and `'b'` in the expression `'a && b'`, pass
  `'&&'`.

  The function also accepts a |count|, allowing you to specify which word you
  want to swap neighbors of, if it appears multiple times in the current line.
  For example pressing `'2\s+'` and enter in |Normal| mode with |backslash| as
  your |mapleader| over the line `'y = a + b + c;'` swaps `'b'` and `'c'`. A
  count of 1 is assumed if none is given.
